# littleBIG

Live demo at [littlebig.herokuapp.com](http://littlebig.herokuapp.com)

A Ruby on Rails learning engine for parents and children to use together.

Instead of questions and answers, text snippets are modeled as *prompts* to encourage free association.
Every prompt can have or be a *response*, and include *concepts* or *characters*. We use CSS and AJAX to
describe these intricate associations visually and to encourage users to create their own.

To run LittleBig yourself, simply download our repo, run a server ('rails s') and see it in action at localhost:3000.

We customized the free Bootstrap theme, [Triangle](https://shapebootstrap.net/item/1524992-triangle-free-responsive-multipurpose-template).
